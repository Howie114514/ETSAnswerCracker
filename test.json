Each correct answer will earn you 20 points and each wrong answer will cost you 10 points. Remember to put up your hands if you have the answer. When I see your hands up, I’ll ask your group to answer. Now let’s start. The first inventor for you to guess is a man. He was born in 1706 in Boston. In 1752, he flew a kite on a rainy day so as to study lightning. Does any group know the answer?",
